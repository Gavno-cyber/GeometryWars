# Game Template (Windows)

A simple framework for prototyping games. \
The framework provides a video buffer and simple keyboard and mouse input.

I tried to make my own Geometry Wars approach by using this template engine. My idea was to make some basic setup for rendering and intersection checking of object shapes and wrap it up in ECS system with Components like VelocityComponent, which you can find in provided code above. I just didn't have time to finish it. I started working yesterday evening, it was my first time Im using C++ for coding, but I made all the functions and logic by myself, without using external libraries and sech. In total, I did this project for about 6 hours and I'm very upset by the fact of really low amount of time I get, because I want this project to be completed.
